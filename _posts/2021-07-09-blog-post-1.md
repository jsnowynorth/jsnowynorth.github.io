In the recent years, you may have heard, or even noticed, the climate is shifting.
This could be winters beginning sooner or later, more hot summer that last longer, a changing monsoon season, or any number of climate differences.
The question is, how much has the climate shifted, and is the same everywhere?
We (my advisors and I) answered this question in [this work](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/env.2665), which I summarize in this post.
In our work, we designed a multivariate spatio-temporal model to the spatial and temporal change in minimum and maximum temperature seasonal cycles as a function of the annual and semi-annual harmonics.


Temperature Data
======

To determine how much the climate has shifted, we use air temperature (deg C) data at two meters above the surface obtained from the [<span style="color:blue"> National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Reanalysis</span>](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/) across the continental United States and portions of Mexico and Canada.
All temperature time series are centered since the focus is on the harmonics and change in harmonics, as opposed to how the raw temperature has changed.
In addition, instead of looking at the trend of the mean daily temperature, a shift in the climate regime is more noticeable if we look at the extremes - the minimum and maximum daily temperature.
Therefore, we extract the daily minimum and maximum temperature for every day between 1979 and 2018, and use that for the analysis.

Now, what does it mean for the climate to shift?
We can represent the temperature at a location for a year in terms of its annual and semi-annual harmonics.
The annual harmonic, or the seasonal cycle, is a direct response to Earth's orbit around the sun.
However, the atmospheric response to the sun crossing the equator twice a year suggests there is a semi-annual component to the temperature cycle, and so we choose to represent the yearly temperature cycle with the two harmonics.

Mathematically, let $z_t$ denote temperature (say, minimum or maximum) on day $t$ where $t = 1, \dots, T$, and $T$ is the number of days in the year (365 or 366 for leap years).
The Fourier series representation of the time series, expressed in amplitude-phase form, is given as

$$z_t = a_0 + \sum_{h=1}^{\lfloor T/2 \rfloor} A_h \cos \Big(\frac{2 \pi h t}{T} + \varphi_h \Big),$$

where $A_h$ and $\varphi_h$ are the amplitude and phase, respectively, for the $h^{th}$ harmonic component.
Alternatively, we can parameterize the Fourier series in terms of Fourier coefficients,

$$z_t = a_0 + \sum_{h=1}^{\lfloor T/2 \rfloor} a_h \cos \Big( \frac{2 \pi t h}{T} \Big) + b_h \sin \Big( \frac{2 \pi t h}{T} \Big),$$

where $a_h$ and $b_h$ are the Fourier coefficients for the $h^{th}$ harmonic, related to the amplitude by $A_h = \sqrt{a^2_h + b^2_h}, \,\, A_h \in [0, \infty)$, and the phase by $\varphi_h = \tan^{-1}(-b_h/a_h), \, \varphi_h \in [-\pi/h, \pi/h]$.
Here we are only concerned with the first two harmonics (i.e., $h=1, 2$, where $h=1$ and $h=2$ correspond to the annual and semi-annual harmonic, respectively), and will refer to a "cycle" as the sum of the first and second harmonics hereafter.

Now, if we have some method of estimating $a_h$ and $b_h$ for $h=1,2$ (and we do), we can then compare the estimates at different times and different locations to see how the climate is shifting.
For example, the figure below shows the estimated cycle with only the annual component (dashed) and the estimated cycle with the annual and semi-annual components (solid) at two locations for two different years.
The bottom panel shows the difference, and highlights not only the impact of the semi-annual component, but how the estimated temperature cycle is changing.

Bayesian Hierarchical Model
======

**Goal:** Quantify the spatial and temporal change in minimum and maximum temperature seasonal cycles as a function of the annual and semi-annual harmonics.

  1. Capture spatial dependence
  2. Capture temporal dynamics
  3. Capture multivariate dependence of these harmonics through spatially and temporally-varying coefficients


Results
------

- Modeled the spatial and temporal change in minimum and maximum temperature seasonal cycles as a function of the annual and semi-annual harmonics
- Used the predictive process for spatial dimension reduction
- Obtained inference on the amplitude and phase of the annual and semi-annual harmonics
- Highlighted areas where the seasonal temperature cycle has changed
- Highlighted the importance of including the semi-annual harmonic when investigating the change in seasonal cycle
