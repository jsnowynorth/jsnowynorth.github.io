# Probablistic Basis Functions

When working with large data (such as spatio-temporal data) it is often convenient to represent it using a low-rank process, which can done using matrix factorization methods such as singular value decomposition (SVD).
SVD decomposes matrix-valued data into the product of basis functions, the left- and right-singular vectors, and associated vector lenghts, the singular values.
The singular vectors can be grouped into an orthonormal matrix (a matrix whose columns are of unit length and orthogonal to the other columns).
For space-time processes, these basis functions can have physical representation and are useful when modeling the process.
I am currently developing distributions and models to estimate the basis functions from SVD, or more generally any orthonormal matrix, in a probablistic manner and incorporate these estimates within more complex spatio-temporal model (paper to come).

# Climate Extremes

Climate change has resulted in the increase in frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as the 2021 Western North America heat wave or Hurricane Harvy.
One of the main goals of the CASCADE group is to investigate the drivers and variability of these extreme events.
As a member of the CASCADE group, I am involved in projects aimed at understanding the drivers and variability of extreme events and at our ability to properly model extremes.


# Data-Driven Discovery of Nonlinear Dynamics

Many real-world scientific processes are governed by complex nonlinear dynamic systems that can be represented by differential equations.
However, because of the complexity of the processes, the differential equations used to represent these systems are rarely known.
My dissertation work focused on Bayesian methods to discover the nonlinear dynamic equations governing complex real-world processes.
