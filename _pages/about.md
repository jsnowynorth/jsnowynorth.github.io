In August 2022 I joined the CASCADE team in the Climate Sciences division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as a Postdoctoral Fellow working with Dr. Mark Risser.
<!-- I am a CASCADE Postdoctoral Fellow in the Climate Sciences division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory working with Dr. Mark Risser. -->
My research focuses on the statistical analysis of climate extremes, data-driven discovery of nonlinear dynamical equations, and joint species distribution modeling.
I am also interested in spatio-temporal statistics, computational methods, variable selection, data visualization, and sports statistics.


Before my postdoc, I received a B.S. in Applied Mathematics, B.A. in Ecology and Environmental Biology, and a minor in Statistics from the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) in 2017.
After CU, I completed a Ph.D. at the University of Missouri Columbia (Mizzou) working with Drs. Christopher Wikle and Erin Schliep.
While at Mizzou, I also helped develop the course work for Methods in Sports Analytics I and II, the foundational courses for <a href="https://stat.missouri.edu/undergrad/sports-statistics> Sports Statistics program </a>.

<!-- My research focuses on estimating nonlinear dynamic equations with a data driven
approach using hierarchical Bayesian methods.
I am also interested in spatio-temporal statistics, dynamic modeling, causal inference, and sports statistics.
Currently, I organize the Space-Time Statistics reading group and
participate in the Sports Statistics reading group, both at the University of
Missouri Columbia.
I also helped develop Methods in Sports Analytics I and II, and am the current TA for the courses. -->

I received my B.S. in Applied Mathematics, B.A. in Ecology and Environmental Biology,
and a Minor in Statistics from the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) in 2017.
While at CU I was an undergraduate teaching assistant for pre-calculus and
probability and a research assistant.
I also participated in the Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Statistical Analysis
(LISA), where I worked on multiple collaborative projects with research faculty
around campus.

Some of my interests outside of work include soccer (football), rock climbing,
snowboarding, hiking, backpacking, and camping.
Feel free to shoot me an email if you want to get in touch!
