I am currently a fifth year statistics Ph.D. candidate at the University of
Missouri Columbia working with Dr. Erin Schliep and Dr. Chris Wikle.
My research focuses on estimating nonlinear dynamic equations with a data-centric
approach using hierarchical Bayesian methods.
I am also interested in spatio-temporal statistics, dynamic modeling,
deep modeling, causal inference, and sports statistics.

I received my B.S. in Applied Mathematics, B.A. in Ecology and Environmental Biology,
and a Minor in Statistics from the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) in 2017.
While at CU, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant for pre-calculus and
probability, and a research assistant investigating short-term forecasting (nowcasting).
I also participated in the Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Statistical Analysis
(LISA), where I worked on multiple collaborative projects with research faculty
around campus.

Some of my interests outside of work include soccer (football), rock climbing,
snowboarding, hiking, backpacking, and camping.
Feel free to shoot me an email if you want to get in touch!
