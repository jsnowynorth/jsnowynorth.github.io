I am a Postdoctoral Fellow working with Dr. Mark Risser in the <a href="https://cascade.lbl.gov/" title="CASCADE">CASCADE</a> group in the Climate and Ecosystem Sciences Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
My research focuses on the probability distributions for basis functions, statistical analysis of climate extremes, data-driven discovery of nonlinear dynamical equations, and joint species distribution modeling.
I am also interested in spatio-temporal statistics, computational methods, variable selection, data visualization, and sports statistics.


Before my postdoc, I received a B.S. in Applied Mathematics, B.A. in Ecology and Environmental Biology, and a minor in Statistics from the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) in 2017.
After CU, I completed a Ph.D. at the University of Missouri Columbia (Mizzou) working with Drs. Christopher Wikle and Erin Schliep.
While at Mizzou, I helped develop Methods in Sports Analytics I and II, the foundational courses for the <a href="https://stat.missouri.edu/undergrad/sports-statistics" title="Sports Statistics program">Sports Statistics program</a>.

Some of my interests outside of work include soccer (or football, I am an avid Tottenham fan - COYS), rock climbing,
snowboarding, hiking, backpacking, and camping.
Feel free to shoot me an email if you want to get in touch!
