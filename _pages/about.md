I am currently a fifth year statistics Ph.D. candidate at the University of
Missouri Columbia working with Dr. Christopher Wikle and Dr. Erin Schliep.
My research focuses on estimating nonlinear dynamic equations with a data driven
approach using hierarchical Bayesian methods.
I am also interested in spatio-temporal statistics, dynamic modeling, causal inference, and sports statistics.
Currently, I organize the Space-Time Statistics reading group and
participate in the Sports Statistics reading group, both at the University of
Missouri Columbia.
I also helped develop Methods in Sports Analytics I and II, and am the current TA for the courses.

I received my B.S. in Applied Mathematics, B.A. in Ecology and Environmental Biology,
and a Minor in Statistics from the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) in 2017.
While at CU I was an undergraduate teaching assistant for pre-calculus and
probability and a research assistant.
I also participated in the Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Statistical Analysis
(LISA), where I worked on multiple collaborative projects with research faculty
around campus.

Some of my interests outside of work include soccer (football), rock climbing,
snowboarding, hiking, backpacking, and camping.
Feel free to shoot me an email if you want to get in touch!
