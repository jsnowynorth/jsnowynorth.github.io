## Abstract
Many real-world atmospheric, ecological, and economic processes are governed by
complex, non-linear, interactions, and differential equations are commonly used
to approximate the dynamics of these complex systems.
While the approximating differential equations generally capture the dynamics of
the system well, they impose a rigid modeling structure that assumes the
dynamics of the system.
Recently, there has been work in the applied math and computer science
community to use a data-driven approach to learn the dynamics that govern
complex systems. Here, we present a Bayesian data-driven approach to non-linear
dynamic equation discovery that is robust to measurement noise and stochastic
forcing.
We show the effectiveness of our method on simulated systems and then apply the
method to a real-world environmental process.
